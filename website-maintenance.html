                                <p>i'm once again at a war with the whole point of making my own website and how i'm going about it. it seems important to me more than ever to hunt down the underlying reason of why i'm so engrossed with the idea of publishing on the internet and how i'm doing it.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>it's weird because i'm positive that this thought loop will close as soon as i know the answer to this question but i have to go so deep as to question my entire philosophy in life just to escape from this.</p>
