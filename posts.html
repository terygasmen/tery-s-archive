                        <h2>looking for a threading system in commonplace books</h2>
                        <div id="content">
                                <p>i realize that the decline of my master notebook usage (or commonplace book) is due to my recent discovery of a threading system that lets me iterate on ideas frictionlessly. telegram might not be the best tool for this but it's been good to me from the start because of its direct reply functionality.</p>
                                <p>the only threading method that works on an analogue system that's familiar to me is something i learned in the youtube bullet journal community years ago. the concept is straightforward but mainly functions on ONE topic of interest.</p>
                                <p>you basically thread the entries on a topic of your choice by writing the page number of the previous entry on the top left corner of the spread and the page number of the next entry on the opposite corner. (can't find the source of this anymore as it was YEARS ago already. i was a preteen and didn't care much about citing sources. sorry.)</p>
                                <p>i do still use the system to this day but it would be too limiting for what i'm trying to achieve now.</p>
                                <p>my WHY on a threading functionality similar to direct replies is essentially to track and iterate on ideas. the logic would be reminiscent of niklas luhmann's zettelkasten BUT instead of using cards, i'd like the portability of a humble notebook.</p>

                        <h2>the boredom challenge</h2>
                        <div id="content">
                                <p>in light of the corporate web, social media platforms walling off data, and the internet taking over our diminishing attention span, i invite you to join me in an indefinite dare of completely embracing boredom.</p>
                                <p>disclaimer: YOU WILL BE BORED</p>
                                <p>here are the nonnegotiable rules:</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li>NO multitasking. focus on a single task before moving on to something else</li>
                                <li>DOCUMENT your progress whichever way you prefer. i recommend getting an actual physical journal OR starting a blog.</li>
                                <li>BE BORED every now and then. don't try to find a distraction when you have absolutely nothing else to do. sit with your thoughts. meditate through the discomfort. embrace it.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>as an example, here's a list i created when i went into this challenge. this mainly revolves around my usage of the internet and social media. yours might revolve around video games, pornography, etc:</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li>when NOT working on the comic, i'm not allowed to 1) surf the internet 2) hang out at netflix</li>
                                <li>during breaks, i can 1) listen to music 2) listen to podcasts 3) use telegram (i use this to write down my thoughts)</li>
                                <li>when going out, 1) bring a book with me 2) bring the flipphone and 3) bring pocket camera</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>if you're signing up for this as i have a few days ago, then such good luck to you soldier! we are one of the few who at least tried something to take back the power of focus. here's an entry i wrote in my journal on march 7, 2024:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                <p>"am i willing to embrace a more sparse connection with the spaces that i love in the digital world? to rely mostly on myself for inspiration and motivation? if i pursue boredom now, i'm going to be letting go of the familiar habitat i've lived in for a very very long time. the world is going to completely change now. time is going to slow down. and i'm going to slow down with it."</p>

                                <p>am i okay with having my thoughts not centralized anymore? some are in here, some are in my journal, some will probably be in hypothesis. the more i keep this up, the more it'll turn into a colossal mess and then i'd probably have to start all over again from zero when i'm fed up</p>

                        <h2>first thoughts on glasp</h2>
                        <div id="content">
                                <p>so i made my first note and two highlights on <a href="https://glasp.co/">glasp</a>. i've been contemplating a lot about using <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">hypothesis</a> but a lot of the annotations i published there doesn't reflect my interests and viewpoint any longer. of course it's always useful to append every bit of history, even the parts you don't necessarily think you need anymore, but starting with a blank slate is more appealing so i went to try glasp after creating my account the other day.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>thoughts:<br />
                        <ol>
                                <li>clunky, with the tagging system at least, and confusing when it comes to tagging a specific annotation or a whole page</li>
                                <li>it's in beta so of course it's not as polished and the direction it goes to may completely change in the future but for now, it's too many features for a few use cases</li>
                                <li>i may just be biased because i love the interface of hypothesis but glasp feels unoriginal, like a patchwork of github, hypothesis and other web highlighter plugins</li>
