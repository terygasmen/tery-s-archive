                                <p>chapter 3 thumbnails are done! revision of the thumbnails starts tomorrow. my brain is officially fried.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>thumbnailing is HARD. HAAARD. it is the most crucial step in the production stage because it determines what your final pages will look like. so every single second in this step is decision-making, decision-making, decision-making. i'm OUT of decisions!</p>
                                <p>i desperately need to get away from all kinds of stimulation and just stare at my window for the next few hours.</p>

                        <h2>chapter 3 has begun</h2>
                        <div id="content">
                                <p>i'm in the beginning stages of chapter 3 production. i did take 2 days off from my schedule and during that time, i was able to air out some thoughts i had with chapter 2. i think i mentioned burnout somewhere in one of my posts and thankfully, it WASN'T. those two days not working on the comic gave me a better perspective on the trajectory i'm headed with this project.</p>
                                <p>here are a couple of goals i have for chapter 3 and/or moving forward:</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li><p>i'm removing the storyboarding step in my comic-making process. it is a fairly new addition to my system and after such a long time not working on any comics last year, i thought this step would help me ease into the overwhelming process of panel and page composition. it did. it helped me focus on one picture at a time. it was also easier to thumbnail down the line when i had my storyboards ready beside me. it was just a matter of patchwork-ing 3-6 panels in a page by then.</p></li>
                                <li><p>i'm naturally inclined to settle with the comic-making process i'm used to following from previous years: scripting, thumbnailing, lettering, penciling/inking, coloring, final rendering. no other thoughts here.</p></li>
                                <li><p>for a while, i have been limiting the way i compose my panels. by this i mean: no subject/s popping out of its panel borders, crazy panel shapes, etc. mostly because i've kind of stopped reading a lot of manga recently and started diving more into evan dahm works. but now that i'm back to reading a lot of manga, i'm once again influenced to go a little more adventurous with my panels.</p></li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>so a lot of it is really putting a lot more attention to my page and panel composition. i'm trying so hard not to touch chapter 2 because you can definitely tell i wasn't having fun working on it. and it's true, it is one of my least favorite chapters in the whole book. BUT i'll catch it all in the next batch of edits. for now, cheers to chapter 3.</p>

                        <h2>the last four spreads of chapter 2</h2>
                        <div id="content">
                                <p>about an hour and 20 mins later, i finished inking a page. a PAGE. i usually work by spreads and somehow, i haven't taken the time at any point in the past to gauge how long it takes me to ink.</p>
                                <p>i'm at the last four spreads of the chapter (so really 8 pages). last night, i managed to letter and pencil all spreads. i could say that but really, when does penciling officially end? my penciling and inking steps don't have that distinctive line dividing it so i can't really tell which is which when i'm in the zone.</p>
                                <p>some thoughts:</p>
                                <ol>
                                        <li>i'm at the stage of the project where the improvements in my art skills are palpable. i'm developing an eye and control over my fingers that existed somewhat scarcely before, or at least these things weren't the primary focus when i was drawing in the past. um i'm not sure if i've hit this stage with my previous projects because i'm positive i've never made something this long before. the improvements i see now can also mean i'm finally settling into a nice footing with the ipad ecosystem which is such a foreign place to me the second month of 2024. i kept switching between two machines and programs every single time i'm working on a spread that it was such an overkill; i had to find a way to reduce the overhead in my system.<br /></li>
                                        <li>burnout! MAYBE burnout, because if not then what is it? it's obvious to me that this isn't creative burnout. it's more of losing steam from AGAIN the overhead of my short-lived past system.<br /></li>
                                        <li>i might be taking a short break from this project after chapter 2 concludes to work on a new short comic project...not saying anything more than that because nothing is set in stone, at least for now.</li>
