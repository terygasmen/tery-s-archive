                                <p>Hey there! Thanks for being here. I'm Tery Gasmen. I'm a writer, illustrator and a comic artist (among many other things), and here's where I carve my own cozy space on the internet.</p>
                                <p>You will find me on a few digital spaces like <a href="https://teryyyg.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/terygasmen/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/teryyyg/">Instagram</a> (although I admit my presence on these sites are relatively sparse if not absolute zero since i'm gradually migrating over to the fediverse), but this is where I will be POSSEing my posts. I do have a <a href="https://linktr.ee/terygasmen">linktree</a> for easy giveaway if you want a master list of where you can find me all over the web.</p>
                                <p>That said, I select pretty constrictively what I publish on these platforms so whatever you encounter on this site will be the primary version of whatever I produce and make publicly available, at least at the time of conception of this website.</p>
                                <p>These days, I've been marinating the thought of taking a giant leap into the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. The three main bullet points listed on their front page are closely reminiscent of what I want the internet to be. And for a while, I was using <a href="https://hypothes.is/users/teryyyg">Hypothesis</a> avidly, similar to IndieWeb's principle on decentralization. </p>
                                <p>This is just a quick intro so my thoughts and plans on this department will be elaborated on in the future. In the meantime, if you're curious, you can always go to IndieWeb's <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>. For actual examples, I recommend looking at <a href="https://boffosocko.com/">Chris Aldrich's</a> or <a href="https://david.shanske.com/">David Shankse's</a>.</p>

                                <p>This website is quite obviously in its infancy so there are tedious tasks in my backlog that I slowly chip away at during my meager free time. BUT for quick onboarding: </p>
                                <ol>
                                <li>the <a href="index.html">welcome page</a> is essentially the entry-point and you decide where it takes you from there</li>
                                <li><a href="comic-updates.html">comic updates page</a>: where I post BTS stuff of my comic projects</li>
                                <li><a href="website-maintenance.html">website maintenance page</a>: extensive news about website updates and plans. The WEBSITE CHECKLIST in the sidebar is the TLDR of it.</li>
                                <li><a href="https://tery.123guestbook.com/">GUESTBOOK</a>: come say hi! i will say hi back...</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Some things to note before you go any further:</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li><strong>a lot of lowercase text</strong>: I text a lot of my thoughts to myself in my phone. The bulk of the writing I do, even the long-form ones, are basically telegram messages. If I happen to care a lot about a specific page, I try to format it nicely in my computer, but I don't bother most of the time.</li>
                                <li><strong>lack of comments section</strong>: the temporary solutionâ€”first, install <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a> into your choice of browser, enable it and voila, the comments section will appear as another layer on the web.</li>
                                </ol>
